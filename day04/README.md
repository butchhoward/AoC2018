suck up the data, sort it, parse out the parts

leaving it all as strings for now other than the guard id

changed my mind. time is ints. streams are nice.

This code is so rough it's embarassing.

OK that's a little better. Solved the problem i was having with the count_if and max_element functions. Learned new things with decltype. Cleaned up the dumpers with stream functions. Still roughish code, but better.
