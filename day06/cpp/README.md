Day 05

Part 1

There has to be a better way. Solved it and the code is a bit nicer than day5, but I am still fighting to get to a solution.

One bit that I changed was  a precalculation I did not have to make.

I got started on a path and stuck with it. Was blinded by a better way until
the performace showed as really bad.

New way ran in 0.5s. Old way was still running after an hour when I killed it.
